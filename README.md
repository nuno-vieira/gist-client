# MVC-N Gist Client
A simple Gist Client application with MVC-N Architecture. 
A good example of a well implemented MVC Application on iOS.

# Dependencies
- **Alamofire** for Network Request. `URLSession` would be enough though. Used just to implement this PoC faster.
- **Kingfisher** for Image Fetching and Caching.
- **Realm** for DB.
- **SnapKit** for AutoLayout.
